"""CX-3: native per-host hook manifests, generated from one mechanism.

CX-2 taught the runtime to *read* five hosts' dialects through one adapter
(`godmode_hostevent.py`). CX-3 is the other half: teaching the *package* to
*ship* a manifest each host actually loads, so the adapter has something to
be called by in the first place. Before this unit, only Claude's hand-authored
`hooks/hooks.json` wired a real pre-tool boundary; Codex's own matcher never
named a Codex tool, Grok never ran the `command` + `args` entries it was
handed, and Cursor had no hook manifest at all.

**Governing rule, repeated from the plan/spec because it is the one this
whole module exists to obey:** every event name, field name, or matcher this
module emits must be traceable to a specific spec addendum or an existing
adapter constant in `godmode_hostevent.py`. An unverifiable name is OMITTED,
never guessed - and the gap is surfaced honestly by `hooks status` /
`hooks install`, not silently shipped as if it were confirmed. Each
constant/builder below cites its source in its own docstring or comment.

**Extends the existing mechanism, does not replace it.** `godmode_bindings.py`
already generates every host's *identity* manifest (`plugin.json`) from one
source file, `packaging/hosts.json`. This module supplies the second kind of
artifact that mechanism's `write()`/`check()` now also drive: *hook*
manifests, whose shape (nested event -> matcher -> command lists) has nothing
in common with the flat identity-field copy `godmode_bindings.render()`
already does, so it gets its own builder functions here - called BY
`godmode_bindings.write()`/`check()`, not a second, parallel entry point.

**File-layout decision (revisited 2026-08-28 on two field reports):** Codex's
build doc and Grok's own 09-plugins.md both name `hooks/hooks.json` as the
one hooks file a plugin carries - the SAME default path Claude loads. Both
hosts fire the shared CamelCase events, so neither gets keys of its own;
their tool names join the shared PreToolUse matcher
(`merge_host_tools_into_shared`). The shared file's entries are shell-form
command strings (`_shell_entry`), the one shape all three parse: the
earlier `command` + `args` pair was Claude's exec form only - Grok resolved
the bare `python` token against the file's directory and failed every hook
open, Codex refused the shape and registered nothing. The dedicated
`.grok-plugin/hooks.json` that revision shipped was never read and is gone.
Cursor's `"version": 1` envelope and `failClosed` field, and Gemini's
settings.json-fragment shape, differ in shape rather than only in path, so
they keep a dedicated file under their own host directory.

# Event-name allowlists. ONE constant per host, each an exhaustive list of
# every hook-config event key this module is willing to emit for that host -
# never a superset "for completeness". `tests/test_host_manifests.py` asserts
# the emitted set from each builder below equals its allowlist here exactly,
# so a future edit that starts emitting an unverified extra event name (or
# silently drops a verified one) fails the test, not a live host.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sprint 4 correction, on evidence that did not exist when the previous
# spelling was chosen. The old comment here recorded its own reasoning
# honestly: the Codex build doc's example was CamelCase, but the event list
# was "NOT published", so an audit observation of `session_start`/
# `pre_tool_use` was preferred over a single documented example.
#
# Both halves of that are now superseded:
#   - OpenAI publishes the full list, and every name in it is CamelCase:
#     SessionStart, SessionEnd, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, PreToolUse,
#     PermissionRequest, PostToolUse, PreCompact, PostCompact,
#     UserPromptSubmit, Stop.
#   - A live `codex exec` session captured the hook firing with
#     `hook_event_name: "PreToolUse"` - Codex reads the CamelCase block,
#     the same one Claude uses, resolving `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` as the
#     documented legacy alias for `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
#
# The snake_case keys were not merely redundant: naming an event Codex
# cannot enable is what left the orphan trust row in the operator's
# `~/.codex/config.toml` (a `trusted_hash` with no `enabled`), and it put
# `apply_patch` - Codex's documented file-edit tool - behind a key that
# never fires, so Codex file edits reached no boundary at all. Codex now
# rides the shared CamelCase events, and its tool names join that matcher.
