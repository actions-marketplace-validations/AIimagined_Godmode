"""Make a skipped step a blocking state instead of an apology afterwards.

Two mechanisms, both deliberately dumb so they cannot be reasoned around:

* Attestation. Every mandated step records what it did, including finding nothing.
  A HARD rule with no attestation blocks the gate it guards.
* Claim binding. An assertion about project state cites records that must resolve.
  An unresolvable citation downgrades the claim to a hypothesis automatically — it
  is not warned about, it is demoted.
