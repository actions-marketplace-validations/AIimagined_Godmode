"""Runtime guardrails: controls that act during a run, at every boundary crossed.

Godmode starts no watcher and no daemon, so "live" here means: cheap enough to
run at every hook boundary. The watchdog is an anomaly scan a host calls per
turn; ceilings are declared limits the host reports spend against; rewind is a
preview-and-authorize mechanism (Godmode never executes the rollback itself);
the arbiter scores competing open plans instead of taking the first.
