"""B4-6 MVP: a per-project structural index, so resume-time context comes
from a cache instead of re-reading source files.

Deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is stated rather than implied:
Python files get top-level classes, top-level functions, and imported
module names via `ast`; every other text file gets a file-level entry
(path + content hash) and nothing more. NOT claimed: methods, call
graphs, control flow, data flow, non-Python symbols - the sweep source's
full ladder is roadmap, and the coverage map carries this row as partial.

Privacy: the index stores names and content hashes only - never a source
body, never a docstring. Incremental by content hash: an unchanged file is
never re-parsed, which is the entire point (the cache must be cheaper than
the re-read it replaces). The index is disposable operational state in the
state home, outside the hash chain - losing it costs one rebuild.

Bounds are stated, never silent: the walk caps files and per-file parse
size, and the report says how many fell outside each cap; the outline caps
its lines and says how many entries are not shown.
