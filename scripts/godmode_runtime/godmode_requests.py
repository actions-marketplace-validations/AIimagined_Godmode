"""What the operator asked for, and whether anything answered it.

Everything else this runtime governs leaves an artefact. A command leaves a
run, a fix leaves a commit, a conclusion leaves a claim that must cite one.
A request leaves nothing. It exists in the agent's recollection and nowhere
else, and recollection is the substrate this product exists to distrust.

That matters most for an input that arrives while the agent is already working.
The host hands it over beside a tool result; the agent answers whichever part
is cheapest to answer and carries the rest in its head. In a long session the
rest is what goes missing, and nobody can point at what was dropped afterwards
because there is no list.

**Recorded live, because it cannot be reconstructed.** Two signals were tried
against a real 9,777-event transcript before this module existed. The notice
the host shows the agent - "the user sent a new message while you were working"
- appears twice in the whole file, once because the agent quoted it: it is
injected at delivery and never stored. And of 113 human inputs, zero carry a
timestamp falling inside a tool call's span, because the stored time is when
the input was delivered rather than when it was typed. After the fact, an
interruption is indistinguishable from an ordinary turn. So the prompt is
recorded as it arrives or not at all.

Findings, never closures - the same contract as `godmode_obligations`. An
agent that could close its own requests would close them the way it currently
forgets them, and the point is to put the question in front of a person.
