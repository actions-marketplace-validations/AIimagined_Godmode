"""Whether the product works, measured — not whether its tests pass.

A green suite proves the code does what it was written to do. It says nothing
about whether the thing being built actually prevents the failures it exists to
prevent: whether a resumed session picks up the stated next action, whether a
root cause survives scrutiny, whether finished work stays finished. Those are
properties of the record the product produced while being used, so they are
computed from the archive rather than asserted.

Two rules keep the numbers honest:

* A metric with no denominator reports `insufficient-data` and a null value. A
  zero-over-zero rendered as 1.0 is the cheapest way to look healthy while
  measuring nothing, and it is exactly the self-report this project exists to
  refuse.
* Every metric states its `basis` - what was counted - so a suspicious number
  can be checked against the records instead of believed.

Nothing here transmits: the metrics are computed locally and printed locally.
