"""Was this already built, and was it already refused.

Two questions, asked at the only moment the answers are worth having: before
the work starts. Both were answered wrong in the session that produced this
module. A sentinel allowlist came one command from being rebuilt after two
shipped releases had already fixed it. A reinvention check designed in an
earlier session was rediscovered from scratch, because nothing read the record
saying it had been designed.

Neither answer was missing. `removal` records why something was deleted,
decisions record what was rejected and why, and the atlas records what exists.
The archive was already holding both, and nothing consulted either.

**It reports where it looked.** An absence claim needs the search that would
have disproved it - the rule this project applies to every other claim. A
`nothing found` produced by a check that examined nothing is worse than no
check, because it reads as clearance.

**Findings, never closures.** Prior work is a reason to look, not a refusal.
Sometimes the earlier rejection was right and the request should stop; sometimes
the constraint that drove it has gone. Only a person can tell those apart, and
an agent that could clear its own precheck would clear it the way it currently
skips it.

**Precedent is a fourth, sharper question.** `already_rejected` above matches
by fuzzy term overlap over free-text `decision`/`lesson`/`request` records - a
weak test by design, because a strong one that reports nothing is the check
that cannot fail. U-V2's disposition register (`godmode_register.py`) is the
precise counterpart: a closed-enumeration `rejected-precedent` entry is a
refusal the archive itself adjudicated, not prose that happens to contain a
refusal word. A task whose normalized terms name a `rejected-precedent` key
is told the sequence and the way through - cite it and supersede it, or drop
the work - rather than being left to rediscover the same refusal by hand.

**Foreign precedent is a fifth question, strictly advisory.** U-E2's
cross-project exchange (`godmode_register.py`'s `reg-foreign:` namespace)
lets a precedent imported from another project's archive travel here as a
FILE, never a network call. It is surfaced the same way `rejected_precedents`
is - matched by the key's own terms, never by fuzzy free-text overlap - but
it never joins `already_rejected`, never contributes to `findings`/`verdict`,
and is labeled distinctly (`foreign precedent (from <fp8>)`) so a reader can
never mistake it for something this project's own archive adjudicated.

**Paired-artifact is a sixth question, GAP-2's other half, also advisory.**
`godmode_minimality.duplicate_authority_findings` catches an *undeclared*
pair drifting apart by *auto-detected* member overlap; this is the
declared, explicit counterpart - a project states "these two artifacts
change together" once, and every later diff is checked against that
statement rather than against a similarity score. Declaring is writing a
`decision` record whose subject is `paired-artifact:<label>` - the same
"reuse an existing kind, namespace the subject" house pattern `removal`
above and `reg:`/`reg-foreign:` in `godmode_register.py` already use. A
paired-artifact charter is project *policy* that a session writes,
revises, and can retire - the same evolving, evidenced, append-only shape
`reg:` decisions already have, not a generated inventory snapshot
regenerated from source the way a static declared-config file
(`capabilities.json`'s shape) is. It is checked here, in `precheck`, and
not in `godmode_fence.completion_audit` (which owns this unit's excluded
scope): `precheck` is the seam an agent already consults *before* touching
files, so a one-sided diff is caught while there is still time to add the
other half, not after the commit already landed. Never blocking: v1 is a
question, same as everything else in this module.
